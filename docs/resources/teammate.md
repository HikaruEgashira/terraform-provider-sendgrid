# sendgrid_teammate (Resource)

Provides a Teammate resource.

Teammates is an account administration and security tool designed to help manage multiple users on a single SendGrid account. Teammates is built for groups of shared users, where each user has a different role and thus requires access to different SendGrid features.

For more detailed information, please see the [SendGrid documentation](https://docs.sendgrid.com/glossary/teammates).

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "sendgrid_teammate" "example" {
  email = "dummy@example.com"
  scopes = [
    "user.profile.read",
  ]

  lifecycle {
    ignore_changes = [scopes]
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `email` (String) Teammate's email
- `scopes` (Set of String) The permissions API Key has access to.

For more detailed information, please see the [SendGrid documentation](https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/account-and-settings/teammate-permissions#persona-scopes)

Note:
Since scopes are automatically added after registering the usernames of invited teammates, there's a possibility that they might differ from the values defined in the Terraform code.
As some scopes that cannot be defined are unclear, the current approach is to use ignore_changes to avoid modifications and instead set permissions on the dashboard, which is preferable.

### Optional

- `is_admin` (Boolean) Set to true if teammate has admin privileges.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `username` (String) Teammate's username
